# Friend Assignation Game

## Overview
The Friend Assignation project is a fun game where players are assigned targets and must complete missions to eliminate them. The game is implemented using Python and PyQt5, providing a graphical user interface for an engaging user experience.

## Files
- **main.py**: The main application file that contains the logic for assigning targets and generating missions for players. It integrates PyQt5 to create a graphical user interface for the game.
- **window1.py**: A basic PyQt5 window setup that defines a `MainWindow` class, creating a simple window with a label.
- **ui/main_window.ui**: A Qt Designer UI file that defines the layout and components of the main window for the application. This file can be loaded into the PyQt5 application to create the GUI.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5
   ```
3. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` file to start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
